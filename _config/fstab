### fields

# <device> 	block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted 
# <dir>		mount directory
# <type> 	the file system type, auto type lets the mount command guess
# 		what type the filesystem is
# <options>	the associated mount options; see mount(8) and ext4(5).
# <dump> 	is checked by the dump(8) utility. Set to 0 to disable dump.
# <fsck> 	sets the order for filesystem checks at boot time; see fsck(8),
#		for the root device it should be 1, for other partitions it
#		should be 2 or greater, or 0 to disable checking.


### useful options

# defaults	use options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser and async
# noatime 	turns off files' atimes recording for increased performance;
#		breaks mutt new mail detection
# noauto	don't mount with `mount -a` and on boot
# noexec 	do not permit execution of any binaries on the filesystem
# lazytime	only update times (atime, mtime, ctime) on the in-memory
# 		version of the file inode; this reduces writes to disk;
#		the on-disk timestamps are updated only when:
#		- the  inode  needs to be updated for some change
#		- the application employs fsync(2), syncfs(2), or sync(2)
#		- an undeleted inode is evicted from memory
#		- more than 24h have passed since the inode was written to disk
# relatime	update inode access times relative to modify or change time,
#		access time is only updated if the previous access time was
#		earlier than the current modify or change time; mutt needs this
# user		anybody can mount the corresponding filesystem
# owner		allow the device owner to mount the filesystem
# group		allow the device group member to mount the filesystem
# ro		read only
# rw		read/write
# noiversion	every time the inode is modified, the i_version field will
#		not be incremented
# loud   	turn off the silent flag
# sync		flush all changes to disks without delay; async is default
# loop		mounts an image as a loop device
# notail	increases performance of ReiserFS at the expense of storage
# 		efficiency 
# nosuid	do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file
#		capabilities when executing programs from this filesystem
# nodev		do not try to detect the filesystem type


### /proc options

 Value                               Description
hidepid=0	/proc/<pid>/* will be world readable; the default.
hidepid=1	The /proc/<pid> directories are visible by all users, but
		users can only access the /proc/<pid> directories they own.
hidepid=2	Same as hidepid=1 but the /proc/<pid> directories of other
		users are hidden.
